# Heat and Work: Discover the Forces Behind Energy Flow

[Live Demo →](https://kennethloto.github.io/heat-and-work/)

## 📄 Project Overview

This is an educational website built to explore the concepts of **Heat and Work** in thermodynamics. It is designed to help users understand energy flow through various sections including pretest, discussion, a summary of the **First Law of Thermodynamics**, post-test, and a team overview. The goal is to provide an engaging, interactive experience to learn the fundamentals of heat transfer and work done in thermodynamic systems.

## 🧰 What’s Inside

| File / Folder | Purpose |
|---------------|---------|
| `index.html`  | Main HTML file containing the navigation, layout, and content for all sections (home, pretest, discussion, etc.) |
| `css/` (or `style.css`) | CSS file that defines the layout, styling, and visual appearance of the website. |
| `assets/` (if any) | Contains images, icons, or other media used in the website (e.g. team pictures, charts, thermodynamic diagrams). |
| … | Any additional resources or files used to enhance the website (e.g. custom fonts, external libraries). |

## ✅ Features & Sections

- **Home Page**: Introduction to the topic of heat and work, with an overview of the website and what users will learn.  
- **Pretest**: A section to gauge the user's prior knowledge on thermodynamics before diving into the content.  
- **Discussion**: Explanation of core thermodynamic concepts and the relationship between heat and work.  
- **First Law Summary**: A clear summary of the **First Law of Thermodynamics**, focusing on energy conservation and how it applies to heat and work.  
- **Post Test**: A follow-up test to assess what the user has learned after going through the material.  
- **Our Team**: Information about the creators of the project, their contributions, and a short bio.
